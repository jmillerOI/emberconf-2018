# How To Build A Bonfire
On Hiring And Training New Devs In The Ways of Ember

- Developing a Culture that Lasts
  - It start small, like aspark
  - Developing a culture of teaching Ember in small steps
  - In hindsight, professional ember training would have been extremely beneficial
  
- How do we scale it?
  - How do we move on to helping out whole team become skilled at Ember?
  - The idea of not merely shipping feature in emebr
  
- Teaching Well
  - Newbies: Folks new to Javascript
  IF ember is the first Javascript framework they're learning, you have a pretty good opportunity to help introduce these ideas.
  Ember has opinions but they're less controversial.
  Ember not only has opinions to learn, but
  - Vets: Experience with JS
  Learning with happens faster
  
- FOundations vs Features
  - The core ideas of Ember
  - The Core toolsset and the opinions
  - To fully understand into JS design patterns
  
- Newbies & Foundations
  - Are impressionable since they don't have much to compare
  Should be limited to exposure until they actually dive into Ember
  - FOllow up after some initial Ember work
  
- Vets & Foundations
  - Less impressionable and more opinionated
  - Foundations might need to be explored more upfront in order to sell and pitch
  
- Feature
  - Things that make ember stick out
  - More general JS stylei like ES6
  - Things that are buzz worthy but not really core to what makes Ember unique.
  
- Newbies
  - Often confused them with the foundations
- Vets
  Features help cemenet why the foundatiosn matter
  - can tell between feature and foundation but may not be ass old on every feature
  
"I'm used to React"
- Common threads around the idea of Components and React Router
- Ember design pattersn are much more structured, Redu x is possible as well
- No more Webpack
- Ember Data and the idea of data modeling are a lot more structure than react

"I'm used to angular"

- Explaining the consistency of Ember vs drastic deprecations of Angular
- Moving away from Webpack
- Shared ideas around Controllers, ROuters, and Services
- Component based ideas might come off as foreign

"I've used EMber 5 years ago"
This is smething not a lot of folks think about.
While a lot of ember has stayed the same, a lot has changed.
Ideas that often required more javascript-centric approach may no longer require that brute force approach.
Conversely, API methods that were previously available may or may not be around.
ES5, ES6, Whatever else is next also has influence Ember.

- Hiring People vs Hiring Skillsets

- People
  - How they work with people is more important thn their skillset.
  - Looking for people who are both teachers and students
  - Looking for people who will make a positive impact on team culture. Doesn't always mean "culture fit".
  
- Skillset
  - More concenred about hriing x skillset for y position
  - Concerned about how open they are in working on things
  - Looking for people who can make a psotivie impact of creating products - results.
  
- Champinion people who
  - Communicate
  - Empathize
  - Deliver Consistently
  
- Hire deliversely Different Sets of People

#### Last Thoguhts
- The structure of opinion that Ember presents can be really hard for folks to adjust to.
- It's really hard to rally around folks a new idea of framework when they've so strongly bought into something else.
- Developers will often resort back to old ways of solving problems if not informed of a new way
- We can use the thigns we've explored to help break the cycles in your teams

## Have a style guide and follow it
### Everyone isn't going to love Ember as much as you do and that's ok!
